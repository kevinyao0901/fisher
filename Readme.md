Fisher (盒武器)


Fisher is a website forging way to do cyber attack.

Here we first use ngrok to get a public domain name and forge a website after we start the flask.

`ngrok http 5000`

You can find your public domain name in the terminal output.

When someone click the website we made up ,  we got his public IP if he wasn't using VPN or other way to hide.

Next we use https://ipstack.com/ to chack the physical localtion of the guy for further cyber attack such as DDOS or something else.

P.S. hammer project for example.

e.g.
https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS
